# ![RealWorld Example App](quarkus-logo.png)

> ### Quarkus Framework codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/)
including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the Quarkus community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to
the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

# How it works

This application basically uses Quarkus Framework with Java 21 with some other modules known to development community:

* Hibernate 5
* Jackson for JSON
* PostgreSQL database
* JPA Criteria
* Auth0 java-jwt

### Project structure:

```
application/            -> business orchestration layer
+-- web/                -> web layer models and resources
domain/                 -> core business implementation layer
+-- model/              -> core business entity models
+-- feature/            -> all features logic implementation
+-- validator/          -> model validation implementation 
+-- exception/          -> all business exceptions
infrastructure/         -> technical details layer
+-- configuration/      -> dependency injection configuration
+-- repository/         -> adapters for domain repositories
+-- provider/           -> adapters for domain providers
+-- web/                -> web layer infrastructure models and security
```

# Getting started


### Grant execute permissions to the Maven wrapper

```shell
chmod +x ./mvnw 
```

### Start local server

Make sure, docker is running as Dev Services will start a PostgreSQL database

```shell
 ./mvnw quarkus:dev
 ```

The server should be running at http://localhost:8080

### Running the application tests

```shell
./mvnw test 
```

### Running k6 e2e tests

Make sure, docker is running as a PostgreSQL container will be started

1. (Recommended) Using [nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act):

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After cloning the repository, make sure to run `dos2unix ./mvnw` if you're using Git Bash. Otherwise, Act might throw an `Error 126`.

```shell
act --cache-server-addr host.docker.internal
```

2. Using the local script:

```shell
./e2e/e2e-tests.sh
```

### Building jar file

```shell
./mvnw package
```

### Building native executable

GraalVM is necessary for building native executable, more information about setting up GraalVM can be found
in [Quarkus guides](https://quarkus.io/guides/)
and database engine need to be changed.

```shell
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

#### Database changes can be made to the application.properties file.

```properties
# Database configuration
quarkus.datasource.db-kind=postgresql
```
